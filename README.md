This audio project enables experimenting mixing different kinds of sounds (natural, urban, people, ...etc.) which we don't usually encounter at the same time, within the same environment. How do we feel if we hear emergency room sounds with ocean wave sounds at the same time? Caf√© and ambulance? thunderstorms and cicadas? What about all of them?
